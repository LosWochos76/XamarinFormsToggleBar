# XamarinFormsToggleBar

This project implements two custom controls:
- A ToggleButton that derives from a standard Button but has another property "IsSelected" to be switched on and off.
- A ToggleButtonBar which uses multiple of such buttons to allow a user to select one of the items.

Please have a look at the example project.
